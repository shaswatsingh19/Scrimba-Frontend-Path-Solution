### Async JS & War Project 

- In the module we learn about more of asynchronous Javascript 
- As JS is single thread language we can't work asynchronously that's why we use callback 


#### Asynchronous JS - Can be run at any point in time, and doesn't block the current code from running 
- Code can be run out of order 

#### Learned about 
- Callback Function 
- Promises
- Async/Await 

#### Work on project 

- War Project - Using Deck of Card API
- Solor Project - Movie Watchlist
