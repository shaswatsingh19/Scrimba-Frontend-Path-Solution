## Grid

- Type of layout tool like flexbox
- As flexbox works with 1-D in grid we can build 2-D layout more easily.
- Simplify our markup, as we don't have to think so hard about how content needs to be grouped resulting in flatter HTML

- lot of different properties to learn  
    - grid-template-columns
    - grid-template-rows
    - grid-auto-rows
    - grid-row-start
    - repeat() 
    - and many more
