## React Basics

- In the module we learn about react
- Build some awesome project on react

#### Why learn React

- React is composable which means we combine different parts to build a whole project which are also referred as components

eg. 
```
root.render(
    <div>
        <Navbar />
        <Main />
        <Footer />
    </div>
)
```

- React is Declarative which means we don't need to tell how to do it, just tell it what to do and it will figure out how to be done.
